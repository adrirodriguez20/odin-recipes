		<h2 class="ingredients">Ingredients:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>1 (12 ounce) package linguine pasta</li>
			<li>¼ cup olive oil</li>
			<li>6 ounces pancetta bacon, diced</li>
			<li>5 shallots, chopped</li>
			<li>2 cups fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
			<li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
			<li>2 pinches freshly ground black pepper, or as needed</li>
			<li>2 pinches dried oregano</li>
			<li>½ cup chicken broth</li>
			<li>½ cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h2 class="steps">Steps</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain, transfer back to the pot, and set aside.</li>
			<li>Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook pancetta in hot oil until just beginning to brown. Stir in shallots, mushrooms, garlic, pepper, and oregano; cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
			<li>Pour in chicken broth; bring to a boil over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 2 minutes. Reduce heat, cover, and simmer for 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
			<li>Strain liquid from the pan into pasta; toss to coat. Divide pasta onto individual serving plates, then top with equal portions of pancetta and mushrooms. Serve with Parmesan cheese and pepper.</li>
